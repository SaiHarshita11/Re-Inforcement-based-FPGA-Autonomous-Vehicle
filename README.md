## 🧠 Abstract

Obstacle avoidance and motion planning for autonomous vehicles is a critical challenge. We proposed a hardware-accelerated reinforcement learning model implemented on an FPGA using Verilog. The agent learns optimal paths on a 4x10 grid using a reward-penalty system while avoiding obstacles and reaching the destination efficiently.
